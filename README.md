# Live Agile Wiki

Welcome to the **Live Agile Wiki**, an evolving framework designed to foster collaboration, alignment, personal grounding and understanding within teams. This repository reimagines agile principles to meet the needs of community-driven environments and uncertain times.

## What is Live Agile?

**Live Agile** rethinks traditional agile frameworks by focusing on:
- **Collaboration over Role Definition**: Fostering shared responsibilities and collective ownership.
- **Outcome-Driven Work**: Aligning efforts with meaningful goals.
- **Continuous Growth**: Integrating reflection and personal development into daily practices.

This approach is at the heart of [Communi.Team](https://www.communi.team), a platform dedicated to building aligned and thriving teams.

## Features
- **Shared Language**:  [Domain Language](wiki/Domain%20Language.md) introduces reimagined terminology to better reflect collaborative and growth-oriented practices.
- **Core Ceremonies**: Supports key practices like daily check-ins, visioning sessions, and reflection meetings.
- **Alignment with our Nested Goal Framework**: Encourages long-term planning through tools like season planning sessions.
  - Use the nested goal template (WIP) to set and track your goals:  [tools/1077 - Nested Goal Tracker [Template].xlsx](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmarvinfray%2Flive-agile%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Ftools%2F1077%2520-%2520Nested%2520Goal%2520Tracker%2520%255BTemplate%255D.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)
